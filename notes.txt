Notes for write up:

Data:
- GDP data coming from bureau of economic analysis (https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm), different from what we put in writeup
- CDC data comes from their underlying cause of death database using their WONDER tool, different from writeup

Concerns:
- CDC censors data: final dataset only covers about 1/3 of us counties in a given year. Can figure out exact censorship rule but will definitely affect analysis


Possible ideas:
- use tableau for visualization
- talk about impact of our findings-- namely, if we find a correlation between unemployment and suicide, this is relevant to society today as many people are being laid off
- add in other sources of data? Maybe psychologists per capita, mental health spending per person? anything we could find
